    FIRSTwiki is not meant to replace something like Wikipedia, but rather it is
    meant to supplement it with FIRST-specific information. When you want to provide
    a pointer to a wikipedia page as the primary source of information, use this
    include. For normal references, use the same mechanism as any other external
    links.
    
    {% include wikilink topic="Topic" %}
    
    TODO: support multiple languages

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

    <a class="alert-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{{ include.topic | replace: ' ','_' }}">{{ include.topic }}</a>
    on wikipedia.
</div>
